# Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a sales dataset to extract key insights, including revenue trends, top-performing products and regions, anomalies, and drill-down analyses. The SQL queries used for the analysis are included in the `sql_queries` directory.

## Key Insights
- **Overall Revenue Trend**: The dataset reveals fluctuations in daily and monthly revenue trends.
- **Top-Performing Categories & Regions**: Certain products and regions contribute significantly to total sales revenue.
- **Anomalies & Patterns**: Some transactions had unusually high discounts, which may indicate promotional campaigns or potential data inconsistencies.
- **High-Value Customers**: A small segment of customers contributed disproportionately to revenue.
